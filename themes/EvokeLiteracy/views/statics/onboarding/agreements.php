Privacy Policy.

17. Registration. Some Interactive Tools require the User to register and have a unique member account, with a User name and password combination according to Section 22, in order to access and use certain features or functions of the Site. To register, the User will be asked for Personal Information. Except as specifically provided for in the Site or herein, the Personal Information provided is only used for technical administration and evaluation of the Site and may be shared with third parties only for these purposes. Examples of this type of data include statistics on which pages are most popular and which are least popular. The data collected is not intended to be traced back to a particular individual/User. The purpose of this data collection is so that World Vision can better understand the preferences of its visitors and improve this Site and its services. In this regard, the User grants World Vision a right to use the data collected according to Section 24.
Notwithstanding, registering on this Site is optional. If User chooses not to register or provide Personal Information, User can still use the Site. However, User will not be able to use some Interactive Tools such as the interactive games, nor be able to receive certain communications such as emails and newsletters, for example.
If User chooses to use any Interactive Tool that requires registering or provision of Personal Information, part of User’s Personal Information such as e-mail address, gender, city, country, school, work, employment or organizational affiliation may be published, translated, distributed, displayed and in general be available to other Users registered on the Site.
User is entitled to cancel his member account anytime as provided in Section 25.
18. Use of cookies. When User registers on the Site, the Site sets a cookie on the User’s computer's hard drive that enables User to manage his subscriptions and online profile. By setting this cookie, the Site will remember User the next time User visits and won't have to bother User by asking questions User has already answered (like address information). However, User is always free to decline our cookies if User’s browser permits, although in that case User may not be able to use certain features and may be required to re-enter information more frequently to use certain services on the Site.
19. IP Addresses. The Site records User’s IP address and data such as browser type and operating system. This data helps us learn about the geographical distribution of our Site visitors and the technology they use to access our Site. This data is not connected with the Personal Information User supplies in connection with registration on the Site, except in certain cases of managing errors, in which case, the contents of the http request are captured when there is an error, which is used for troubleshooting.
20. Security. The Site employs a range of technologies to protect the data maintained on our systems. Despite such undertaking, it is possible for Internet-based communications to be intercepted, subject to unauthorized access, lost, misused, disclosed, modified, forged, destroyed or targeted by cyber attacks. Therefore, as stated in Section 4, World Vision cannot ensure that User Content and Information will not be intercepted, subject to unauthorized access, lost, misused, disclosed, modified, destroyed, or targeted by cyber-attack.
21. Security Notice. World Vision reserves the right but not the obligation to monitor any Content, where posted on this Site.

Unauthorized attempts to upload Content or change Content or Materials on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law. If monitoring reveals evidence of possible criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to law enforcement personnel.
22. User Names and Passwords. Member accounts, User names and passwords are personal to each User. Users shall not allow any others to use their member account, User name or password under any circumstances. Each User is responsible for guarding his password carefully with the full awareness that a failure to keep his password secure will enable others to engage in transactions for which the User will be legally responsible. Users shall notify immediately World Vision according to Section 30 if they become aware of or believe there is or may have been any unauthorized use of (or activity using) their member account, User name or password or any other need to deactivate their member account, User name or password due to security concerns.
