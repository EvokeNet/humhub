                As a member of the Evoke Literacy community (whether a mentor or agent), I understand and agree to the following:<br><br><br>
                I will be responsible and ethical in my interactions with children and other vulnerable populations.<br><br>
                I will work to protect these populations from getting hurt.<br><br>
                I will ensure that the children and guardians know they have a choice to participate.<br><br>
                I will respect the culture of the individuals with which I interact.<br><br>
                I will be sure to speak clearly and in a language easily understood by children and adults.<br><br>
                I will not make promises that canâ€™t be kept.<br><br>
                I will respect the privacy of the children and other populations, always making sure to ask before recording what is spoken or taking pictures/video.<br><br>
                I will keep identities secret and respect the wishes of the participants.<br><br>
                I will act appropriately when working with others, respecting their space, time, and needs.<br><br>
                If during my Evoke Literacy work, I come in contact with a child or person who is in need of help-then I will report the issue to the proper authorities.<br><br>
                By clicking the agreement link, I understand that it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable populations I come in contact through my work on Evoke Literacy.<br><br>
